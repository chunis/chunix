*** How to build

run 'make clean && make', you will get chunix.img in the root directory


*** How to run

1. bochs:
* In root dir, just type 'make bochs',
or:
* go to the root directory of chunix, and run:
	>> bochs -f hd.bxrc

2. qemu:
* In root dir, just type 'make qemu',
or:
* go to the root directory of chunix, and run:
	>> qemu -hda chunix.img -hdb hd.img

3. grub + qemu:
* In root dir, just type 'make grub'. But first you need to add youself to
sudoers, since it needs 'sudo' to update the floppy.img.


Enjoy!  :-)
