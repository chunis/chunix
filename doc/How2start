How to Run Chunix


1. Preparation

You need to build Chunix under Linux, and with below tools available: gcc, as,
ar, ld, nm, make, qemu
Also you need 'sudo' permission since we need run 'mount' to update kernel
You may using bochs instead of qemu, but I haven't checked with bochs for a
very long time, so...Good Luck! :)


2. Build

Build is very simple, but need pay a little attention, since some Makefile
targets doesn't work (yet).
These 2 targets work for sure: grub-sfs and grub-sfs-gdb, so run one of these:
>> make grub-sfs	# just run
>> make grub-sfs-gdb	# enable gdb debug
You may run 'make clean' or 'make cleanall' if you like.



3. Run

With ablow command, you should already run Chunix now. You can run it again
without re-make it by one of these:
>> qemu -m 32 -serial mon:stdio -fda floppy.img -hdb hd.img
>> qemu -m 32 -serial mon:stdio -fda floppy.img -hdb hd.img -S -gdb tcp::1234


Enjoy!  :-)
