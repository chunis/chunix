About ChuniX


chunix is a small x86 os, used for learning osdev.
The project was started in code.google.com, and the code was managed by hg.
But since it's difficult to push code to code.google.com in China,
I move the code to github, and using git to manage the code instead of hg.
But other files/wikis... will still keep in the old url as:
	http://code.google.com/p/chunix/

You may alse interested in my private Chinese blog: http://www.chunix.org
